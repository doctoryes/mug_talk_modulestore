# edX and MongoDB

OpenEdx platform usage of MongoDB

--

* Forums

--

  Ruby application integrated into the platform

--

  (I won't cover it in this talk.)

--

* Course assets

--

  Uses GridFS to store binary assets.

--

* Courses

--

  Via the edX modulestore.

# What is a "modulestore"?

An interface to create and query course content, backed by storage.

The storage used by edX:

**Why does edX store courses in MongoDB?**

---

# edX History

--

- First course: MIT 6.002x

--

- Content was coded directly into XML

--

- Here's an XML course [example](assets/simple_course.xml).

--

- Subsequent courses were XML-based courses

--

- All XML courses loaded into memory at startup

--

- Works fine for tens of courses - but not 100s...

---

# XML course problems

- Up until late-2015, edX still served all the original 41 XML courses.

--

- Each process loaded each XML course into memory upon startup.

--

- Each process consumed 745 MB of RAM.

--

  (edx.org runs a few hundred processes.)

--

- Each process took around 10 minutes from startup until servicing users.

--

  Why? Because loading all the XML courses took that long.

--

  Without loading the XML courses, startup takes only 30 seconds.

---

# Why MongoDB?

The thinking:

--

We need to load/unload course parts on-demand!

--

So we'll use a database.

--

Hmmm - we've got course information with a varied schema.

--

It'd be nice to store the information without defining a schema.

--

And to be able to query the course information irregardless of the schema.

--

Maybe MongoDB?

---

# Aside: How does MongoDB store info?

--

- Documents

--

  Free-form JSON objects

--

- Collections

--

  Named collection of documents

--

  Roughly equal to an RDBMS table...

--

```javascript
db.inventory.insertOne( { item: "canvas", qty: 100, tags: ["cotton"], size: { h: 28, w: 35.5, uom: "cm" } } )
```

---

### edX Course

.float-left.scale50[![Course tree diagram](assets/edx_course.png "edX Course")]

Basically a directed acyclic graph (DAG)...

---

# Draft Modulestore

--

a.k.a "Old Mongo Modulestore".

--

* Stores course modules (XModules).

--

* On-demand loading of course modules.

--

* Single collection to hold all courses.

--

* Each document is a course module/block.

---

# Draft Modulestore

Let's look at some documents:

* [Video Module](assets/old_mongo_video_doc.txt)
* [HTML Module](assets/old_mongo_html_doc.txt)
* [Problem Module](assets/old_mongo_problem_doc.txt)

---

# Draft Modulestore Issues

--

* No (1st class) re-run support

--

  Shipped without concept of the same course re-running in multiple semesters/terms.

--

  Significant work to change it and migrate existing courses.

--

  So the work was never done.

--

  Course re-runs supported by using a different "course" name.

---

# Draft Modulestore Issues

--

* No versioning

--

  A single draft branch and a single published branch

--

  Suppose you want to publish several course blocks.

--

  Those blocks are copied directly from the draft branch to the published branch.

--

  Non-atomic operation to live course material.

--

  Last published course version is forever lost.

--

(Hindsight is 20/20)...

---

# Draft Modulestore Issues

--

Optimal for some query patterns

--

Non-optimal for other query patterns

---

# Draft Modulestore Issues

--

"Return a list of all video modules in a course."

--

Algorithm:

--

* Start at the root course node.

--

* Load all children of each node.

--

* If child is video node, add to list and stop.

--

* Else: repeat.

--

Nearly all course modules must be queried.

--

Many MongoDB "find()" queries of a small number of documents on each query.

--

Sure - blocks can be cached (and they are). But adds complexity.

---

**Time to re-design..**

---

# Draft Versioning Modulestore

a.k.a. Split Mongo Modulestore

--

* Optimizes for frequent course traversal

--

* Adds versioning

--

* "Split"s out course structure from course content

---

# Split Modulestore

--

Three different collections:

--

* modulestore.active_versions
* modulestore.structures
* modulestore.definitions

---

.float-left[![Split course diagram](assets/split_course.png "Split Course")]

---

# modulestore.structures

--

Each document is an entire course structure.

--

_Immutable_ once created!

--

An example [structure](assets/split_structure.json) document

---

# modulestore.definitions

--

Contains _only_ the content of a course block

--

No reference to a specific course

--

No reference to content's location within a course

--

An example [definition](assets/split_definition.txt) document

---

# modulestore.active_versions

--

One document per course

--

Points to course structures

--

* One draft branch structure

--

* One published branch structure

--

An example [active_versions](assets/split_active_versions.txt) document

---

# Split Modulestore Query Example

--

"Return a list of all video modules in a course."

--

One query for the active_versions document by course id.

--

One query for the course structure document by _id.

--

Traverse the in-memory structure, finding all video modules.

---

# Split Modulestore Course Editing - Details

Suppose you edit a course - what happens?:

--

1. version_structure()

--

* Queries existing structure from MongoDB

--

* Deep-copies the existing structure

--

* Updates its edit_info to tie it to the previous structure.

---

.float-left[![Split version_structure() example](assets/clone_structure.png "version_structure()")]

---

# Split Modulestore Course Editing - Details

1. version_structure()
2. Edit the new structure

--

* Adding/deleting blocks

--

or

* Adding/deleting metadata

--

or

* Changing structure

---

.float-left[![Split structure edit example](assets/edit_structure.png "Structure Edit")]

---

# Split Modulestore Course Editing - Details

1. version_structure()
2. Edit the new structure
3. update_structure()

--

* Saves the new structure to MongoDB

---

.float-left[![Split structure save example](assets/structure_save.png "Structure Save")]

---

# Split Modulestore Course Editing - Details

1. version_structure()
2. Edit the new structure
3. update_structure()
4. update_course_index()

--

* Updates the course index in the active_versions collection with the new structure ID

---

.float-left[![Split structure repoint example](assets/structure_repoint.png "Structure Repoint")]

---

# Problems We've Encountered

--

Structures for large courses have become "large".

--

* Over 1 MB.

--

* Due to some module data being stored there

--

  (...which doesn't actually need to be there.)

--

* Structures were designed to be "small" and queried often.

--

* Not a MongoDB-specific issue - but...

---

# Problems We've Encountered

--

An old problem first...

--

Externally-hosted MongoDB - compose.io

--

* No (easy) access to logs.

--

* Hard / impossible to tune for our usage.

--

* Large structures and many structure queries at peak loads caused performance problems.

  Primarily NAT network overload.

--

* To fix performance issues, we pickle, compress, and cache course structures in memcache.

---

# Problems We've Encountered

* Graph of NAT traffic before and after that optimization was deployed.

.float-center[![Before/after optimization](assets/structure_nat_usage.png "Structure NAT Usage Before/After")]

---

# Problems We've Encountered

Split structure version storage

--

* At launch, we had no plan for archiving old structure / definition versions.

--

* We'd deal with it "later".

--

* As stated before, structures became "large".

--

* Every course edit copies the existing structure and creates a new one.

--

* After several months, storage became an issue.

# Problems We've Encountered

Split structure version storage

* However, as of last month (Oct 2017), the structure storage size had increased somewhat...

--

  2 TB! (uncompressed...)

--

* Dave Ormsbee and Microsoft (via OSPR) created a script to delete unused structures.

--

* Now, structure storage is back down to:

--

  300 GB (uncompressed...)

---

# Problems We've Encountered

Split Course Concurrent Edits

--

* MongoDB does not support multi-document transactions.

--

* Atomicity only at the single document level.

--

* Scenario:

  Suppose multiple course authors are modifying the same course simultaneously.

---

# Problems We've Encountered

Split Course Concurrent Edits

.float-left[![Concurrent course edits](assets/concurrent_course_edit.png "Concurrent Course Edits")]

# Problems We've Encountered

Split Course Concurrent Edits

.float-left.scale80[![Split structure repoint example](assets/structure_repoint.png "Structure Repoint")]

---

# Problems We've Encountered

Split Course Concurrent Edits

The Fix:

--

* At update_course_index() time, check the current structure ID.

--

* Is it the same structure ID from which my edited structure was derived?

--

* Yes? No problem - good to go.

--

* No? Edit conflict has occurred!

--

  Ask the author whether they want to merge, abort, or overwrite.

---

# Problems We've Encountered

Split Course Concurrent Edits

The Confession:

* The Open edX platform currently does *not* implement this fix. (sadface!)

--

* It's possible to experience lost changes with multiple concurrent course authors.

--

* NOTE: The changes aren't actually *lost*, just on a branch with no subsequent generations.

--

* Perhaps YOU! would like to fix this problem.

--

  We accept Open Source Pull Requests!

# Problems We've Encountered

GridFS

--

* Requirement: Binary assets can be stored & served to course students.

--

* Requirement: Support asset "locking" so that only course registrants can access the assets.

--

* Thinking: We're already using MongoDB to store courses.

--

  GridFS exists and can store binary data in MongoDB.

--

  Let's use it!

--

* Reasonable thoughts at a glance...

---

# Problems We've Encountered

GridFS

* The Root Problem:

--

  The application is reading the binary data from MongoDB via GridFS.

--

  And streaming it to each asset requestor.

---

# Problems We've Encountered

GridFS

* Imagine this scenario:

  A course deadline approaches for a course that's popular around the globe, particularly in parts of the world that have only low bandwidth Internet connections.

--

  A large number of students request a large course asset (let's say 100 MB) at around the same time.

--

  Takes around 2.5 minutes to download a 100 MB file using mobile 3G speed (~6 Mbit/s).

---

# Problems We've Encountered

GridFS

* Imagine this scenario:

  Each course asset download ties up an application worker for the entire download time.

--

  Less and less workers to serve other website traffic.

--

  RESULT: Spikes, alerts, alarming death spiral, postmortems, etc.

---

# Problems We've Encountered

GridFS

* GridFS wasn't _really_ the problem here.

--

* The edx-platform usage of GridFS was the real problem.

--

* Nonetheless, a cautionary tale...

--

* We have mitigated this problem somewhat by serving some course assets _externally_.

  Asset is retrieved from AWS Cloudfront - which uses LMS/GridFS as origin.

--

  ...but for "unlocked" assets only.
