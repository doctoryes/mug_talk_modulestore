We created this to give you &ldquo;the basics&rdquo; of how courses work at edX. Almost all edX courses have weeks, lessons, lectures, homework assignments, and exams. This demo course has three example weeks &ndash; most courses last 4 to 12 weeks.</p>\n<p>You are in Week 1, Lesson 1. Lessons typically include things like videos, readings, interactive questions, laboratories and more. &nbsp;These are presented from left to right, in&nbsp;the row of links above. At edX we call this a <em>lesson</em> or a <em>learning sequence.</em></p>\n<p>Explore the lesson sequence by clicking on the icons above or the arrows below.&nbsp; We tried to make these fun, so make sure to check out each item. &nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"ap_listener_added\">&nbsp;</div>"
